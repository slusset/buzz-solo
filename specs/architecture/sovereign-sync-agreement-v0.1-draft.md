# Sovereign Sync Agreement v0.1 (draft)

Status: draft for discussion; partially implemented in the portable relay
adapters and not yet upstreamed. Kind numbers are provisional pending assignment
in the shared registry (`buzz-core/src/kind.rs`). The IDD source for operator
experience and testable behavior is
`specs/capabilities/sovereign-sync-agreements.capability.yaml`; this document
defines the supporting mechanism and vocabulary.

## Scope

A sync agreement governs a **selection of signed events**. It does not package
artifact bytes and it is not itself a shared context:

- an **event stream** is one immutable filter, mirror, or upstream-source
  selection identified by a stream ID;
- a **shared context** is a human-visible NIP-29 space identified by an `h` tag
  and may be carried by an event stream;
- an **artifact** is immutable content named by a SHA-256 `x` tag on an accepted
  event and transferred separately under access inherited from that reference.

## Decision

A **sync agreement** is not a new protocol object. It is a matched pair of
signed **sync declarations** — one published by each sovereign party — whose
contents are compatible and which pin one another. Replication between the
parties is already governed by the portable replication and identity
profiles; the agreement layer makes the *governance itself* durable,
attributable, and observable.

This replaces nothing at the transport boundary. Peer evidence (NIP-98/NIP-42)
still authenticates every session; destination policy still admits every
record; declarations are names and intent, never credentials.

## Identity roles

The vocabulary intentionally keeps five roles distinct:

1. **Owner identity** signs declarations and controls one node's policy.
2. **Node principal** is a stable operator label whose transport keys may rotate.
3. **Transport verification key** proves a caller may move records for a named
   source or read grant.
4. **Event author** signs the exact Nostr event being transported.
5. **Custodian** stores or relays authorized events and blobs without becoming
   their owner or author.

An `export` offer names counterparty **owner identities** permitted to answer
the offer. `admit` and `read` grants name **transport verification keys**. A
node that separates application ownership from transport therefore uses
different public keys in these positions.

## Why a matched pair, not a countersigned document

A Nostr event carries one signature. Rather than inventing a
countersignature envelope, each party signs its own half:

- the **source** declares what it exports and to whom;
- the **destination** declares what it admits and from whom.

An agreement **exists** exactly when the two declarations match under the
deterministic rule in *Matching*. Three properties fall out:

1. **Tension stays visible.** An unmatched declaration is an observable
   proposal or an observable drift, not a hidden config difference. When one
   party revises its half, the match breaks until the other party re-pins —
   the disagreement is in both journals, timestamped and signed.
2. **Both journals hold the whole agreement.** Declarations are ordinary
   events; they replicate over the same streams they govern. After one sync,
   each party's journal contains both halves.
3. **No coordination server.** Matching is a pure function over two events
   any observer can evaluate.

## Kind

One provisional kind, `3070x` (**TBD**), parameterized replaceable. All
declaration roles share it; the `d` tag disambiguates:

```
d = "<role>/<stream-id>"        role ∈ { export, admit, read, key-grant }
```

Addressable semantics give each `(party, role, stream)` cell last-write-wins
with the NIP-01 tie-break, and the monotonic `created_at` discipline from
NIP-AE §Writing applies. Revocation is a replacement whose body carries
`"status": "revoked"` — history of the grant remains in the journal; only
the head changes.

## Declaration roles

Bodies are JSON in `content` (plaintext — declarations govern streams, and
their observability is the point; anything private belongs in what the
streams carry, not in the governance). Unknown fields MUST be ignored.

### `export` — source-side

Declares one exported stream. The selection is part of the stream's
identity: changing it requires a new stream ID (established invariant from
the selective-streams work).

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 3070x,
  "tags": [
    ["d", "export/rendezvous/ted-sovereign"],
    ["p", "<destination-owner-pubkey>"]          // zero or more owners allowed to answer
  ],
  "content": {
    "status": "active",
    "selection": { "from_source": "ted-laptop/sovereign" },
      // exactly one of: {"mirror": true} | {"filter": [ ... ]} |
      //                 {"from_source": "<id>"}
    "cursor_space": "cf-sqlite-v1:",             // informative
    "artifacts": "referenced"                     // none | referenced (see below)
  }
}
```

### `admit` — destination-side

Declares the destination-controlled binding for one stream: which transport
principal, under which verification keys, pinned to which export.

```jsonc
{
  "tags": [
    ["d", "admit/rendezvous/ted-sovereign"],
    ["p", "<transport-principal-pubkey>"],       // one or more active keys
    ["e", "<export-declaration-event-id>"]       // the pin (see Matching)
  ],
  "content": {
    "status": "active",
    "principal": "did:buzz:node-b-puller",       // stable label; keys rotate
    "retention": { "keep": "journal" }           // journal | effective
  }
}
```

### `read` — source-side reader grant

Authorizes a principal to drain an exported stream (the rendezvous role).
Same shape as `admit` seen from the other side: `d = "read/<stream-id>"`,
`p` = reader transport verification key(s), `e` pin to the export declaration.

### `key-grant` — compartment capability record

Records that a compartment's read capability was conveyed to a grantee. The
event contains **no key material** — the key moves out of band; this is the
attributable record that it moved, and the anchor for rotation discipline.

```jsonc
{
  "tags": [
    ["d", "key-grant/ctx-buzz"],
    ["p", "<grantee-pubkey>"]
  ],
  "content": {
    "status": "active",
    "compartment": "<compartment-pubkey>",       // public label, not the path
    "granted_at": 1785090000,
    "rotation": "on-revoke"
      // encryption grants cannot be retracted; revocation of this
      // declaration obligates the grantor to rotate the compartment
      // (new derived key, new #p label) for future content
  }
}
```

### `steward` — operational role grant

Delegates bounded *operational* attention over a node to an agent principal.
Never configuration authority, never key custody: a steward watches and
reports; every power beyond that requires its own future vocabulary
revision, granted one declaration at a time as observed reporting earns it
(the apprenticeship discipline).

```jsonc
{
  "tags": [
    ["d", "steward/cf-rendezvous"],
    ["n", "cf-rendezvous"],                      // the node under stewardship
    ["p", "<steward-agent-pubkey>"],             // NIP-OA-capable agent key
    ["h", "<shared-context-id>"]                 // where reports land
  ],
  "content": {
    "status": "active",
    "principal": "did:buzz:steward-cf",
    "powers": ["observe", "report"]
      // v0 closed set. "observe": read journal, declaration heads, and
      // derived config state. "report": publish plain events into the
      // named shared context. A steward declaration confers NOTHING else —
      // not admits, not grants, not deploys.
  }
}
```

Steward reports are ordinary kind-1 events tagged into the shared context —
deliberately, so any upstream client renders the steward's work as channel
conversation and the delegation history stays humanly auditable.

## Compatibility invariant: degrades to plain events

Every primitive in this specification is expressible as NIP-01 signed
events and filters. Declarations are addressable events; streams are
filters; agreements are matched event pairs; artifact manifests are `x`
tags on events; operating configuration is the evaluation of declaration
heads. The replication ports, rendezvous read endpoint, and artifact store
are **optimizations, not dependencies**.

Consequently: **any Buzz or Nostr relay can custody sovereign primitives
without understanding them.** A vanilla community relay stores declarations
as ordinary addressable events and serves them over ordinary REQ. Adapters
that do understand the vocabulary get governance, provenance, and blob
custody; adapters that do not still get correct storage and delivery.
Nothing in the sovereign layer may break this property.

## Shared contexts: the binding is a space

A binding between two sovereigns is not a config artifact — it is a
**shared context**: a space both parties write into, carrying the
relationship's own record (declaration halves, session records, shared
tooling, steward reports). The context does not describe the binding; it
*is* the binding.

The shared context ID and stream ID are separate. The `h` tag names the space a
person opens; the stream ID names one delivery selection that may carry that
space. Multiple streams may custody the same context under different topologies
without changing the context's identity.

Shared contexts are scoped with NIP-29 `h` tags — deliberately upstream's
group vocabulary, so:

- a **two-member shared context** is a sovereign binding;
- a **community Buzz relay** is the N-member case of the same object, with
  relay-equals-group-equals-boundary as its (legitimate) governance model;
- an unmodified upstream client can open a binding as a channel — the
  relationship is browsable with tools that know nothing of this spec.

Custody of a shared context can live on either party's node or on a
rendezvous custodian; authority stays with the members' keys (custody and
authority separate, as everywhere else in this architecture).

## Unilateral bindings (legacy counterparties)

Matching (below) requires both halves — correct between vocabulary-speaking
sovereigns, impossible when the counterparty is a legacy relay that will
never mint declarations. A binding to such a counterparty is declared
**unilaterally**: the sovereign side publishes its half with
`"mode": "unilateral"` in content, documenting what it exports to and
admits from the counterparty. The counterparty's *observed behavior* is the
de facto other half; the unilateral declaration is the attributable record
of intent that drift reporting (a steward duty) measures behavior against.
A unilateral declaration governs only its author's own adapters — it
confers nothing on the counterparty and claims nothing about consent
(security invariant 5 is unchanged).

## Matching

An agreement over stream `S` between source `A` and destination `B` exists
iff all of the following hold at the current heads:

1. Source owner `A` has an active `export/S` declaration whose `p` tags include
   destination owner `B`.
2. Destination owner `B` has an active `admit/S` declaration whose `p` tags name the transport
   principal actually presenting evidence, and whose `e` tag equals the
   event ID of `A`'s current `export/S` head.
3. The declarations agree on the stream ID byte-for-byte.

This match expresses mutual owner intent only. Pull or rendezvous-mediated
delivery additionally requires an active `read/S` grant naming the presenting
transport key. Destination ingest additionally evaluates the `admit/S`
transport keys. Agreement state and transport readiness MUST be reported
separately: neither implies the other.

Rule (2)'s pin is the drift detector: if `A` replaces its export declaration
(new selection ⇒ new stream ID; new readers or metadata ⇒ same `d`, new
event ID), `B`'s pin goes stale and the match breaks **visibly** until `B`
re-pins. Tooling SHOULD surface unmatched-declaration state; runtimes MAY
refuse to serve or ingest unmatched streams (strictness is adapter policy in
v0.1, normative in a later revision once operational experience accumulates).

## Artifacts

`"artifacts": "referenced"` in an export declares that events on the stream
may reference content-addressed blobs (`x` tags, pack digests) and that the
source (or the rendezvous custodian) serves them from its artifact store to
the same principals authorized for the stream. The event stream is the
manifest: a destination discovers missing blobs by walking references in
records it has already verified, fetching by hash, and verifying content —
possession is idempotent, so blob sync inherits the stream's
interruption-safety without its own cursor.

Git repositories are the special case that needs no special case: packs and
manifests are artifacts; ref state is NIP-34 `kind:30618`; the agreement
governs the stream those events travel on.

## Mapping from current operator configuration

| Today's config | Becomes |
| --- | --- |
| `streams.json` entry (laptop) / `BUZZ_REPLICATION_STREAMS` (Cloudflare) | `export/<stream>` declaration |
| `peer-trust.json` entry / `BUZZ_REPLICATION_PEERS` | `admit/<stream>` declaration |
| `BUZZ_REPLICATION_READERS` entry | `read/<stream>` declaration |
| hand-delivered compartment key | `key-grant/<label>` declaration |

Migration is mechanical: derive the declaration from the config entry, sign,
publish, and (optionally) regenerate config *from* the declaration heads —
at which point the journals are the source of truth and the files are a
cache. The four-places-edited-by-hand drift observed in practice is the
problem this ordering removes.

## Runtime evaluation (v0.1 adapter policy)

Adapters derive operating configuration from declaration heads at defined
evaluation points — the laptop adapter at process start, the Cloudflare
adapter at each replication request. Three rules:

1. **Owner anchor, node scope.** Only declaration heads authored by the
   node's owner pubkey AND carrying an `n` tag equal to the node's own label
   govern that node's configuration. Both anchors are bootstrap data (laptop
   `--owner`/`--node-label`, Cloudflare `BUZZ_OWNER_PUBKEY`/`BUZZ_NODE_LABEL`);
   they are identity, not policy, and stable across deploys. The `n` tag is
   what keeps a replicated journal safe to evaluate everywhere: one owner's
   declarations for different nodes coexist in every copy of the journal,
   and each node evaluates only its own. A head without an `n` tag governs
   no node's configuration (it can still be a relationship half). Foreign
   declarations remain relationship halves — they confer nothing without a
   matching owner half (invariant 5).
2. **Per-domain precedence, wholesale.** The domains are `admit/*` (sink
   peer trust), `export/*` (stream exports), and `read/*` (reader grants),
   each scoped to this node's label. If the journal holds *any* owner-signed
   head in a domain for this node — whatever its status — the journal
   governs that domain entirely and file/env config
   for the domain is ignored; only `status: "active"` heads confer trust.
   File/env is consulted solely when the journal holds no head in the
   domain (bootstrap). Revocation is therefore irreversible by fallback: a
   domain whose every head is revoked is an empty domain, not a reversion
   to files.
3. **Fail closed.** No owner anchor means no journal-derived configuration.
   No heads and no bootstrap config means empty trust.
4. **Artifact access follows reference.** A custodian serves a
   content-addressed blob only to (a) the owner, or (b) a principal holding
   an active `read` grant on a stream whose journal events reference the
   blob (`x` tag). Uploads are accepted only from the owner or admitted
   replication peers. An unreferenced blob is invisible to everyone but the
   owner. Events are the manifest; the reference closure extends per-stream
   visibility to blob custody with no separate artifact ACL.

## Security invariants

1. Declarations are intent, not credentials. Transport evidence and
   destination verification are unchanged and remain mandatory.
2. A `key-grant` event never contains key material, path names, or slugs —
   only the compartment's public label and the grantee.
3. Revoking `admit` or `read` takes effect at the next evaluation; revoking
   `key-grant` obligates compartment rotation (confidentiality of already-
   conveyed content is not retroactively recoverable, and the spec does not
   pretend otherwise).
4. Matching is evaluated over declaration *heads*; superseded declarations
   remain in both journals as history.
5. A declaration naming a counterparty confers nothing on that counterparty
   without the counterparty's own matching half.

## Explicitly outside v0.1

- Kind number assignment (upstream registry decision; 30700 provisional).
- Relay-side enforcement of matching (adapter policy for now).
- Steward powers beyond `observe`/`report` (each future power is its own
  vocabulary revision, granted per-act as reporting earns it).
- Multi-party (>2) agreements and delegation chains (shared contexts hold
  N members, but agreement matching stays pairwise).
- Negotiation protocol (offers are just unmatched declarations).
- Retention auditing and proof-of-custody.
- NIP-77-style set reconciliation (orthogonal efficiency upgrade).
