# Domain Model Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Local relay | A single-process, one-community Buzz node intended for local experimentation. |
| Signed event | A Nostr event whose ID and Schnorr signature verify. |
| Durable event | A signed event outside the NIP-01 ephemeral kind range. |
| Effective event | The event currently visible after replaceable-event rules are applied. |
| Event log | An append-only newline-delimited JSON record of accepted durable events. |
| Subscription | A client-selected set of Nostr filters receiving historical and live matching events. |
| Stable node | A node whose acknowledged durable history survives restart and remains attributable. |
| Portable relay core | Deterministic verification, classification, reduction, and filter behavior shared by relay adapters. |
| Port | A required relay effect whose implementation varies by runtime. |
| Adapter | A runtime-specific implementation of transport, storage, subscription, policy, or effects. |
| Event journal | The source of accepted durable history, independent of its storage representation. |
| Relay decision | The normative result of submission: stored, duplicate, superseded, ephemeral, or rejected. |
| Conformance profile | A named set of observable relay guarantees implemented and tested by an adapter. |
| Replication source | A durable-history port that exports exact signed events in journal order. |
| Replication cursor | An opaque position interpreted only by the source stream that issued it. |
| Replication sink | A destination port that independently applies source policy, verification, and normal ingest. |
| Checkpoint-safe receipt | A terminal destination outcome after which an orchestrator may persist the source cursor. |
| Event author | The Nostr public key whose signature covers an event's exact envelope. |
| Principal | A person, agent, relay node, or system identity recognized by local security policy. |
| Authenticated principal | An ephemeral, audience-bound result proving current control of an authorized verification method. |
| Append context | The declared origin of an append: direct, replication, or system. |
| Relay node principal | A stable node identifier, potentially a DID, whose active verification keys may rotate. |
| Peer binding | Destination-controlled configuration binding one replication source to an authenticated relay node principal. |
| Delegation | A cryptographically verified, scoped grant allowing a principal to act under explicitly stated conditions. |
| Read authorization | Request-level and per-event policy applied consistently to query, count, historical, and live delivery. |
| Stable node key | A normalized operator-controlled routing identifier selecting one logical relay state boundary; it is not a credential. |
| Coordination atom | The smallest logical unit whose ordering and mutable state meet in one stateful runtime instance. |
| Cloudflare relay adapter | A portable relay implementation using Worker ingress and one SQLite-backed Durable Object per stable node. |
| Conformance tier | One evidence environment: deterministic kernel, local Workers runtime, or deployed preview. |
| Object eviction | Removal of a Durable Object's in-memory instance while its durable storage remains available for reconstruction. |
| Sovereign owner | The application identity authorized to sign policy declarations for one or more nodes. |
| Node principal | A stable identity naming an operated node independently of its rotating transport keys. |
| Transport verification key | A key used to authenticate replication reads or deliveries; it does not own policy or event content. |
| Event stream | One immutable selection of signed events identified by a stream ID. |
| Stream export | A source-owner declaration offering an event stream to named counterparty owners. |
| Stream admit | A destination-owner declaration accepting a pinned export and naming transport keys allowed at its sink. |
| Stream read grant | A source- or custodian-owner declaration allowing named transport keys to drain an export. |
| Stream agreement | A current matched export/admit pair expressing mutual owner intent independently of transport readiness. |
| Shared context | A human-visible NIP-29 space identified by an `h` tag; it may be carried by one or more event streams. |
| Artifact reference | An `x` tag from an accepted event to immutable bytes named by SHA-256. |
| Rendezvous custodian | A node that holds and relays selected events or referenced artifacts without becoming their author or policy owner. |
| Steward mandate | An owner-signed grant allowing an agent to observe and optionally report without changing configuration. |
| Harness adapter | A host integration that translates agent-session callbacks and tools into bounded-context commands without owning context identity or policy. |
| Context binding | The unique, fail-closed association between one harness session and one opted-in bounded context. |
| Lifecycle residue | Metadata-only start, completion, or interruption evidence written for an agent session inside its context boundary. |
| Context checkpoint | A local, manifest-last replacement that records accepted artifact drift and repository metadata without implying publication. |
| Node context | The identity-bound durable aggregate: journal, profile references, declarations, cursors, context heads, artifacts, and checkpoints required for this node to remain this node. |
| Sovereign node runtime | The portable application boundary that operates one node context and owns synchronization, cursor, retry, coherence, and compatibility semantics. |
| Host adapter | An OS/runtime-specific implementation of declared supervision, placement, custody, clock/wake, session, or attestation capabilities; it has no domain authority by itself. |
| Host capability manifest | A signed host-local declaration of mechanical capabilities and opaque references available to a node runtime. |
| Wake signal | A host or peer indication that the node may evaluate work now; it carries no stream, cursor, grant, or transition authority. |
| Sync session | One node-owned execution of the common synchronization lifecycle for a source-bound stream and direction. |
| Coherence observation | A read-only four-state result for one named invariant and subject, with bounded evidence references. |
| Runtime release | Signed provenance, integrity, and compatibility evidence for executable artifacts; it is never authority over journal state. |
